# Project Overview

## Character Sheet Generator

## Project Description

An app that allows users to generate character sheets for various homebrew campaigns, and any other reasons they might want to have a custom character sheet. The Apple have several sample buttons that will allow the user to start with pre-generated information and then edit and save that information to create their character. If they wish they can also start with a blank character sheet and create a completely custom character from scratch.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I'm very logical based so I believe coming up with the game structure and populating the air table will be easy.
### Weaknesses:
I am very weak when it comes to CSS and styling so creating a character sheet layout that looks good will be challenging for me.
### Opportunities:
I think that this will be a fun project that integrates things that I love to do in my free time with practical skill applications.
### Threats:
Imposter syndrome, general procrastination.
